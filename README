Hufflib is a Huffman compression/decompression library for KnightOS, a 3rd party OS for TI
calculators.  It uses a precomputed Huffman tree due to the limitations of the TI platform (and
because the size of the data being compressed is usually small).  It achieves good compression
ratios with a reasonably fast decompression speed and constant memory usage (around 3 or 4 KB).

To build the library, follow these steps:

The library uses a precomputed tree which can be generated with gentree.py.  First you must put
some reference files into the sources/ directory; these are analyzed by the script to determine
the optimal compression algorithm to use.  Good things to use are KnightOS userland binaries,
a large text document, etc.  (Data files will ultimately be distributed with hufflib.)
Then, the simplest way to invoke the script is to simply run

    make hufftree.asm

which will create hufftree.asm.

To build hufflib itself, you need to copy it to within the KnightOS source tree and rebuild
KnightOS. (This is because KnightOS does not currently have an easy mechanism to incorporate 3rd
party files; hopefully, this will be changed soon.)  Copy or link the specified files into their
corresponding directories:

- hufflib.asm       packages/hufflib (you will have to create this directory)
- hufftree.asm      packages/hufflib
- hufflib.inc       inc/

Then, apply the patch makefile.patch to the main KnightOS Makefile (suitably change the path):

    git apply makefile.patch

and rebuild KnightOS.
